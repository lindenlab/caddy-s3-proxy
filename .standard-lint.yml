# This wil will be auto-updated by checkdeps to match the version in
#    extraction-makeworld/configs/checkdeps/standard-lint.yml
#
#  If you NEED to have custom lint rules for a paticular repository you can change the name
#  of this file make your updates.  Then change the lint target in the Makefile to reference your
#  custom file.
#
#  If we need to update this config to add new linters, get rid of deprecated linters, etc.  You can just make
#  the change in makeworld and then it will propogate to all repos using this file as developers run 
#  checkdeps --fix in those repos.
